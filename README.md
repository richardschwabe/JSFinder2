# JSFinder2

Rewrite of JSFinder

Loosely based on https://github.com/Threezh1/JSFinder/blob/master/JSFinder.py

Keep in mind there are lots of false positives in the URL. However, the subdomain finding works great.

# Todo

[x] create a subfolder for each domain
[x] add option to load urls from file
[] support flag that url is a js file
[] crawl subdomains for more js files
[] threading ?
[] json output file ?
